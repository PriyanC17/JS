# JavaScript Practice Projects

Welcome to the JavaScript Practice Projects repository! This repository is dedicated to various JavaScript projects aimed at helping you practice and enhance your JavaScript skills. Currently, it contains one project, **Simon Says**, but it will be regularly updated with more exciting projects as I continue my practice.

## Projects

### 1. Simon Says
The Simon Says game is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order. This project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic using JavaScript.

**Features:**
- Interactive game interface with four colored buttons
- Randomly generated sequences of colors to challenge the player
- Sound effects for each button press
- Increasing difficulty with each round
